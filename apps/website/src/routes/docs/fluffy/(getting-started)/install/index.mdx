# Using Fluffy

## Step 1: Install the Headless Kit

To get started with the Fluffy (styled) Kit for Qwik UI, you first need to install the headless package:

<InstallExample />

## Step 2: Add CSS variables

Then you need to add the CSS variables to your root CSS file:

<RootCssExample />

## Step 3: Modify your tailwind.config.js file

Finally, you need to modify your `tailwind.config.js` file:

<TailwindConfigExample />

Now you can start building beautiful Qwik websites.
Choose from each of the ready made components and read their installation instructions.
