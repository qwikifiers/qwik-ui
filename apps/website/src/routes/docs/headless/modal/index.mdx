# Modal

A panel that appears above all other content, blocking interaction with the rest of the page.

<ShowcaseHero />

> Looking for something above other content that doesn't block interaction with the rest of the page? Check out [Qwik UI's popover component](../../../docs/headless/popover/).

## Why use a headless modal?

Modals are used when an important choice needs to be made in the application. The rest of the content isn't interactive until a certain action has been performed.

Qwik UI builds on top of the `dialog` element, and solves the following issues:

### Native dialog pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Unintuitive focus locking behavior',
    'No scroll locking behavior',
    'Unintuitive user agent styles',
    'Confusing terminology (non-modal dialogs)',
  ]}
/>

> The dialog element is the `<Modal.Panel />` component in Qwik UI. This is one of the few cases where we believe the native behavior is a great foundation.

## Dialog extendability

<ShowcaseHero />

Above, we mentioned the Modal component uses the `dialog` element. This means you can also use the native [dialog element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) to customize the modal.

> We ask that you avoid directly opening the native dialog element. This is not supported by Qwik UI. Use the `bind:show` prop instead.

### Attribute example

<ShowcaseAutoFocus />

Above is an example of the `autofocus` attribute, used to focus the 2nd input when the dialog is opened.

> When adding properties on `<Modal.Panel />`, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself.

## Programmatic behavior

To programmatically open or close the modal, we can use `bind:show`, a signal prop that allows us to reactively control the modal state.

<ShowcaseProgrammatic />

`isOpen` is a signal that we pass into our Modal component to customize when the modal can be open or closed.

## The Top Layer

<img src={topLayer} class="mb-6 rounded-base" />

In Chrome and Edge, a `top layer` UI button is shown in the dev tools. This means the element content is placed above any other content on the page, preventing any overflow or style issues.

The top layer is used in both the **Modal** and **Popover** components of Qwik UI.

> The previous implementation of modals required the use of [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal), the top layer pseudo class is a **native solution** to this problem. No more z-index wars!

## Backdrops

To add a backdrop, the `::backdrop` pseudo element can be used. [Backdrops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) are right underneath top layer elements.

By default, the `dialog` element comes with a subtle backdrop, below is a snippet customizing the backdrop background along with the [backdrop filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) css property.

<CodeSnippet name="backdrop.css" />

<ShowcaseBackdrop />

> Styling a [backdrop in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur) can be done using the `backdrop` prefix.

## Dismissing Modals via Backdrop

<ShowcaseBackdropClose />

By default, modals are dismissed when clicking the backdrop. To disable this behavior, set `disableOnBackdropClick={true}` on the `<Modal.Root />` component.

## Alertdialog

An alert dialog is a modal that interrupts user workflow to convey critical information and obtain a response. It's typically used for confirmations, error messages, or destructive actions.

<ShowcaseAlertDialog />

By adding the `alert` prop to our component, we adhere to the [WAI ARIA Alertdialog specification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/), enabling assistive technologies to distinguish alert dialogs for special handling.

Alertdialogs cannot be dismissed by clicking the backdrop, regardless of whether the `disableOnBackdropClick` prop was set to true.

## Focus Locking

Focus locking prevents focus from leaving the modal.

<ShowcaseHero />

Using the Tab key to navigate through the modal will cycle the focus from the last to the first focusable element automatically.

## Stripped Styles

As a headless library, Qwik UI avoids adding styles to components. However, it uses native solutions where appropriate, which may include browser default styles.

These default styles can be difficult to manage, so they have been removed from the Modal component to simplify debugging.

<CodeSnippet name="stripped-styles.css" />

While in most cases, this would be up to a consumer's CSS reset to solve, in this case we are **stripping** the max-width and max-height styles on the dialog element under the hood.

This is done in a separate layer so that styles are easily overridable in consumer facing applications.

## Animations

Modals require smooth entry and exit animations to enhance user experience. However, animating properties like display and overlay can be challenging because they are discrete properties and not traditionally animatable.

Modern browsers have introduced discrete animation capabilities, allowing us to animate these properties effectively. Below, we'll explore how to implement animations and transitions for modals using keyframe animations and CSS transitions.

### Keyframe Animation Example

Keyframes are ideal for handling the entry and exit of the modal. Here's an example using modalOpen for opening and modalClose for closing the modal:

<ShowcaseAnimatable />

### Transition Declarations

Transitions are useful for animating properties like opacity and transform. Here's how to implement transitions for the modal:

<ShowcaseTransition />

<TopLayerAnimationsCaveats />

### Backdrop animations

To animate the modal's backdrop, use the `::backdrop` pseudo-element and include it in your keyframes or transitions:

<ShowcaseBackdropAnimatable />

## Sheets

Sheets are a type of modal/overlay used to provide temporary access to important information, while also being easily dismissible.

### Side Sheet

<ShowcaseSheet />

### Bottom Sheet

<ShowcaseBottomSheet />

Bottom sheets are more prevalent in mobile applications, usually to simplify UI.

### Animations / Transitions CSS

<CodeSnippet name="animation.css" />

## Stacked Modals

Although this is not always a recommended pattern, modals can be stacked. Focus will be trapped within the last opened modal.

<ShowcaseStacked />

## Example CSS

The example for the CSS used in all of the examples above can be found below.

<CodeSnippet name="modal.css" />

### SSR dilemma

Unfortunately, to create modals that open on page load in the web, it needs to be done eagerly on the client. (including existing implementations)

<CodeSnippet name="page-load.tsx" />

> There is currently discussions from the Open UI group about the possibility of a modal dialog that can open on initial load.

## Keyboard interaction

<KeyboardInteractionTable
  keyDescriptors={[
    {
      keyTitle: 'Escape',
      description: 'Closes the dialog.',
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Tab',
      description:
        'Moves focus to the next focusable item in the modal. If none, then loops back to the last item.',
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Shift + Tab',
      description:
        'Moves focus to the previous focusable item in the modal. If none, then loops back to the last item.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## API

### Modal.Root

      description: 'A way to tell the modal to not hide when the ::backdrop is clicked.',
    },

      info: '() => void',
      description: 'An event hook that gets notified whenever the modal gets closed.',
    },

      type: 'function',
      info: '() => void',
