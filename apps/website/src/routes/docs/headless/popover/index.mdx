# Popover

A popup that goes above other content on the page. You can still interact with the rest of the page while the popover is open.

<Showcase name="basic" />

The Qwik UI Popover component is built on top of the [Native Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API). Support is in every browser, and will increase over time.

While we wait for support though, Qwik UI uses a polyfill under the hood for you, so that you can use the component in all browsers.

## Building blocks

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { Popover } from '@qwik-ui/headless';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <Popover.Root>
      <Popover.Trigger>Trigger</Popover.Trigger>
      <Popover.Panel>Panel</Popover.Panel>
    </Popover.Root>
  );
});
```

## What is a Popover?

A popover is a **non-modal** UI element that creates overlays around a DOM element. Non-modal meaning the rest of the page can be interacted with while the popover is shown.

It's great for displaying additional information or options without navigating away from the current context.

<Showcase name="inspect" />

> It is the web's native solution to [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal), which are commonly used in other JavaScript frameworks.

### When would I use a popover?

It can help prevent overflow issues within your UI, and make sure your content is above everything. The popover component guarantees that your items in the panel remains above the rest of the page.

> Many other Qwik UI headless components use the Qwik UI Popover.

## Caveats

<Note status="warning">
  While we handle most of the hard stuff, there is some details that should be considered.
</Note>

### Styling open popovers

```tsx
.popover-panel[data-open] {
  background: green;
}
```

Use the `data-open` attribute on the `<Popover.Panel>` component to specifically style the popup when it's open on all browsers.

### Cross-browser Animations

Entry and exit animations have often been a frustrating experience in web development. Especially trying to animate between `display: none`, a discrete property.

Until recently, discrete properties were not animatable. Luckily, there's [new properties to CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/entry-exit-animations) that solve this problem.

The browser support for these is similar to support of the popover API. That said, the Qwik UI team has done an awesome job of managing animations on polyfill browsers for you using the `data-open` and `data-closing` attributes.

```css
.my-transition {
  transition:
    opacity 0.5s,
    display 0.5s,
    overlay 0.5s;

  /* on new-line so the declaration is valid in all browsers */
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;

  /* starting style for all browsers */
  opacity: 0;
}

.my-transition[data-open] {
  opacity: 1;
}

.my-transition[data-closing] {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Above is an example of a transition that works across browsers. The `allow-discrete` property allows us to transition both display and overlay. Overlay is a property that allows us to transition top-layer behavior.

> In the rare case of a browser supporting the popover API, but not the overlay property, the element functionality is the same but does not transition.

## Popover modes

### Auto

By default, a popover is auto.

<Showcase name="auto" />

An auto popover will automatically hide when you click outside of it and typically only one can be shown at a time.

Auto popovers dismiss when clicking outside of them and pressing the escape key. There can also only be one auto popover open at a time.

### Manual

A manual popover gives you more control over the popup.

<Showcase name="manual" />

Manual popovers do not dismiss unless you click on the `<Popover.Trigger>` or programmatically close them.

## Programmatic Behavior

To programmatically open the `Popover.Panel`, Qwik UI provides a couple functions from the `usePopover` hook.

<APITable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'showPopover()',
      type: 'QRL',
      description: 'Opens the popover.',
    },
    {
      name: 'hidePopover()',
      type: 'QRL',
      description: 'Closes the popover.',
    },
    {
      name: 'togglePopover()',
      type: 'QRL',
      description: 'Toggles the popover between the open and closed.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

We can control where the popover is floating by using the `bind:anchor` prop. We pass it a signal, and use that signal as the anchor's `ref`.

Then, make sure to add an ID to the `<Popover.Root>` component. This ID must match the ID provided to `usePopover`.

```tsx
// a more advanced use case
const { showPopover, hidePopover } = usePopover(popoverId);

useTask$(async ({ track }) => {
  track(() => context.isListboxOpenSig.value);

  if (isServer) return;

  if (context.isListboxOpenSig.value) {
    showPopover();
  } else {
    hidePopover();
  }
});
```

Above is an example of how we programmatically open and close the popover in the Qwik UI Select component.

> In the native spec, these are methods, although we want to ensure code executes on interaction in all browsers, including the polyfill.

## Floating Behavior

By default, the Qwik UI Popover will float below the trigger component.

<Showcase name="floating" />

To make a popover float, we use JavaScript to choose where the popover should be positioned.

Floating mode makes the bundle a bit bigger. We try to keep the API small but still powerful.

### Opt out of the floating library

We can opt out of the floating library by setting `floating={false}` on the `<Popover.Root>`.

Instead, the popover will be fixed position, and you can use CSS to position it.

> When all browsers support the CSS anchor API, you can get floating behavior in pure CSS! Shaving off some size.

## Configuration

The `Popover.Root` component is designed for positioning elements that float and facilitating interactions with them.

### Hover

If we'd like to show the `Popover.Panel` on hover, we can use the `hover` prop.

<Showcase name="hover" />

### Custom Floating Position

By default, popovers will float below the trigger component.

When setting `floating` on the root, you can customize the position of the popover.

<Showcase name="placement" />

Above we have set the `floating` prop to `right`, and so the `<Popover.Panel>` will be positioned to the right of the trigger.

#### Start & End

This also includes moving things to specific corners of the anchor.

<Showcase name="corners" />

You can suffix the direction with `-start` or `-end` to move the popover to the start or end of the anchor.

### Flip

Enabled by default, we can use the `flip` prop to flip its position based on the available space in the viewport.

<Showcase name="flip" />

To disable flipping, set `flip={false}` on the `<Popover.Root>`.

### Gutter

In the previous docs examples, we use the gutter property on the listbox. Gutter is the space between the anchor element and the floating element.

<Showcase name="gutter" />

## Styling

Styles can be added normally like any other component in Qwik UI, such as adding a class. The Popover API however, exposes the `[popover]` attribute.

If Tailwind is the framework of choice, then styles can be added using the [arbitrary variant syntax](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants) or [@apply](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply) command. Below is an example of styling with `[popover]` as an arbitrary variant.

<Showcase name="styling" />

> The arbitrary variant can be customized/abstracted even further by [adding a variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-variants) as a plugin in the tailwind config.

### Floating preset

By default, the popover API comes with built-in browser styles, including fixed behavior, margin, the list goes on.

There are times when we want to override this behavior. An example being when we want floating behavior.

Qwik UI strips the following styles when in floating mode:

<CodeSnippet name="floating.css" />

We put it under an `@layer` so that it can be easily overridden when adding your own styles.

> `data-floating` is a data attribute that gets added to the popover when you set the floating prop to true.

## Animations

<Showcase name="animation" />

To use an animation, add the following CSS classes to the component.

- The `data-open` attribute determines the animation that happens when it is first opened.

- The `data-closing` class determines what class is added when the listbox is **closed**.

Here's the CSS imported from the example:

```css
.popover-animation {
  transform: scale(0);
}

.popover-animation[data-open] {
  animation: popover-grow 0.5s ease-in-out forwards;
}

.popover-animation[data-closing] {
  animation: popover-shrink 0.4s ease-in-out forwards;
}

@keyframes popover-shrink {
  from {
    transform: scale(1);
  }

  to {
    transform: scale(0);
  }
}

@keyframes popover-grow {
  from {
    transform: scale(0);
  }

  to {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

> These classes also apply to transition declarations as well. Below is an example of that use case.

### Transition declarations

Transitions use the same classes for entry and exit animations. Those being `data-open` and `data-closing`. They are explained more in the `Caveats` section.

<Showcase name="transition" />

> The [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) is another native solution that aims to solve animating between states. Support is currently in around **~71%** of browsers.

CSS from the example:

```css
.popover-transition {
  opacity: 0;
  transition:
    opacity 0.5s,
    display 0.5s,
    overlay 0.5s;
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
}

.popover-transition[data-open] {
  opacity: 1;
}

.popover-transition[data-closing] {
  opacity: 0;
}
```
