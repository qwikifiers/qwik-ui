# Modal

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Modal content is placed in the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer), rendering the underneath content as [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) / non-interactive.

<ShowExample example="hero" />

The modal makes use of the HTML `dialog` element, which is supported in [every major browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog).

> For non-modal UI elements, it is preferred to use [Qwik UI's popover component](../../../docs/headless/popover/) _(in progress)_. In the near future, Qwik's popover component can be applied to the most-semantically-relevant HTML element, including the `<dialog>` element itself for non-modal dialogs.

Modals are used when an important choice needs to be made in the application. The rest of the content isn't interactive until a certain action has been performed.

    },
  ]}
/>

## Dialog extendability

<ShowExample example="inspect" />

The Qwik UI Modal component is built on top of the `dialog` element. To see additional capabilities of the dialog, take a look at the [offical MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog).

Our goal is to fill existing gaps, ensuring the modal is a11y compliant and enriched with HTML spec features, reducing reliance on Qwik UI maintainers.

### Attribute example

<ShowExample example="autoFocus" />

Above is an example of the `autofocus` attribute, used to focus the 2nd input when the dialog is opened.

> When adding properties on `<Modal />`, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself.

## Open or close the modal

To open or close the modal, we can use `bind:show`, a custom signal bind that leverages the [bind](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/rendering/#bind-attribute) syntax in Qwik.

<ShowExample example="inspect" />

`showSig` is a signal that we pass into our Modal component to customize when the modal can be open or closed.

The example above opens the modal when the **Open Modal** button is clicked and closes it when a button inside the modal is clicked.

> In the future, we may not need to manage state for the opening and closing of dialogs and other UI elements. Here's Open UI's [invoker proposal](https://open-ui.org/components/invokers.explainer/).

Custom signal binds are like a remote control for components, controlling states like opening or closing a modal.

## The Top Layer

<ImgTestImage class="mb-6 rounded-xl" />

In Chrome and Edge, a `top layer` UI button is shown in the dev tools. This means the element content is placed above any other content on the page, preventing any overflow or style issues.

The top layer is used in Qwik UI whenever a modal or popover is used in supported browsers. Popovers can be applied to any semantic element, modals in Qwik UI are tied to the `dialog` element.

> The previous implementation of modals required the use of [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal), the top layer pseudo class is a **native solution** to this problem. No more z-index wars!

## Backdrops

To add a modal backdrop, the `::backdrop` pseudo element can be utilized. [Backdrops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) are right underneath top layer elements.

By default, the `dialog` element comes with a subtle backdrop, below is a snippet customizing the backdrop background along with the [backdrop filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) css property.

<BackdropCss />

<ShowExample example="backdrop" />

Styling a [backdrop in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur) can be done using the `:backdrop` selector. In the example code below, we've changed the brightness based on dark or light mode, along with a blur.

<ShowExample example="hero" />

## Dismissing Modals via Backdrop

Modals in Qwik UI can be dismissed by default when the backdrop is clicked. However, this behavior can be modified using the `closeOnBackdropClick` property.

<ShowExample example="backdropClose" />

The example above demonstrates a modal where the `closeOnBackdropClick` property is set to false. As a result, clicking on the backdrop does not dismiss the modal.

## Alertdialog

An alert dialog is a modal that interrupts user workflow to convey critical information and obtain a response. It's typically used for confirmations, error messages, or destructive actions.

<ShowExample example="alertDialog" />

By adding the `alert` prop to our component, we adhere to the [WAI ARIA Alertdialog specification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/), enabling assistive technologies to distinguish alert dialogs for special handling.

Alertdialogs do not allow the backdrop to be closed when clicked, regardless of whether the `closeOnBackdropClick` prop was set to true.

## Focus Locking in Modals

Qwik UI incorporates a feature known as focus locking, which confines the focus within the modal component when it is open.

<ShowExample example="inspect" />

This means that if a user is navigating through the modal using the Tab key, reaching the last focusable element and pressing Tab again will cycle the focus back to the first focusable element within the modal.

> Focus locking behavior is provided by default in Qwik UI. If you encounter any use cases that require customized focus lock behavior, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/issues) on our GitHub repository.

## Animations

Animating things to display none has historically been a significant challenge on the web. This is because display none is a `discrete` property, and is **unanimatable**.

> There is currently efforts to solve this problem. [New CSS properties](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/entry-exit-animations/) have been introduced, but currently do not provide good enough browser support.

### Our current approach

Qwik UI automatically detects any `animation` or `transition` declarations under the hood and waits for them to finish before closing the modal. If there is no animation, then it will close normally.

### Adding a transition

<ShowExample example="transition" />

To add an transition, use the `modal-showing` and `modal-closing` css classes. Above is a snippet where we transition both the modal and backdrop's opacity.

### Adding an animation

<ShowExample example="animation" />

To add an animation, it's the same as with transitions, using the `modal-showing` and `modal-closing` css classes. Below is a snippet of the animation example above.

<AnimationSnip />

### Backdrop animations

Backdrop animations have also made significant progress in the last year, with support provided in over half of the major browsers, and close to 70% of users.

To add a backdrop animation, make sure to use the `::backdrop` pseudo selector to the end of the `modal-closing` or `modal-opening` classes.

> Firefox currently does not support backdrop animations. The fallback for browsers that do not support animated backdrops is the same as a non-animated backdrop.

## Sheets

Sheets are a type of modal/overlay used to provide temporary access to important information, while also being easily dismissible.

### Side Sheet

<ShowExample example="sheet" />

### Bottom Sheet

<ShowExample example="bottomSheet" />

Bottom sheets are more prevalent in mobile applications, usually to simplify UI. That said, feel free to use them wherever fits best!

## Open on page load

There might come a time where a modal is needed open as soon as the page loads. Unfortunately, to create modals a client-side API is currently needed regardless of implementation.

### SSR dilemma

Qwik is the first framework with an [SSR portal implementation](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#solution). SSR Portal capabilities are unique to Qwik City, because the alternative frameworks require a client-side API for portal functionality, such as `document.appendChild`.

The problem with rendering the modal in the server, is that we lose some critical behavior:

- The content behind the dialog is not inert (non-modal)
- Focus and scroll lock customizations break
- Will not work with meta frameworks like Astro.js

The current solution across framework ecosystems, is to open the Modal eagerly on the client to keep the proper functionality.

<PageLoadSnip />

> We believe that the dialog element will have native support for SSR Modals in the future, gaining this behavior in the process.
