# Progress

A visual indicator that shows how much of a task has been completed.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## In progress

While the input state is not complete, the progress component is "in progress".

<Showcase name="hero" />

The `data-progress="in-progress"` attribute is applied to the progress and its indicator.

## Max

The `max` prop is used to set the maximum value of the progress bar.

<Showcase name="max" />

## Min

The `min` prop sets a minimum value for the progress bar.

<Showcase name="min" />

## Complete

If the progress is complete, the `data-progress="complete"` attribute is applied to the progress and its indicator.

<Showcase name="complete" />

## Indeterminate progress

When the progress is not known, the progress should be indeterminate. A progress bar can be indeterminate when the value it receives is `null`.

<Showcase name="indeterminate" />

When in the indeterminate state, the progress and its indicator have the `data-progress="indeterminate"` attribute.

> Indeterminate progress is useful for showing that an operation is ongoing, but its completion time or progress percentage is unknown.

## Initial Progress

To set the initial progress, you can pass a `value` prop to the `Progress.Root` component.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## Reactive Progress changes

To dynamically update the progress bar, pass in a signal to the `bind:value` prop.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

> The example above randomly updates the progress bar's percentage when the button is clicked.

## CSR

Similar to other Qwik UI headless components, the Progress Bar automatically renders based on its environment. The previous progress bars are rendered on the server.

<Showcase name="csr" />

The example above shows the progress bar being rendered on the client when the `isRendered` signal is set to `true`.
