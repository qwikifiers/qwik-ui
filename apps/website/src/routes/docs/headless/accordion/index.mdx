# Accordion

A set of interactive sections that show or hide connected information.

<Showcase name="hero" />

    'Follows the WAI-Aria design pattern',
    'Full keyboard navigation',
    'Can open one or multiple items at a time',
    'Supports initial and reactive values',
  ]}
/>

## Building blocks

### 🎨 Anatomy

    {
      name: 'Accordion.Root',
      description: 'The primary container for the accordion.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Item',
      description: 'A single disclosure widget.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Header',
      description: 'The heading element of an accordion item.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Trigger',
      description: 'Activates to show or hide the accordion content.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Content',
      description: 'Displays the content when its connected trigger is actived.',
    },

## Why use a headless accordion?

While you can create a native disclosure with HTML elements like `details` and `summary`, there are some limitations and issues with them.

### Native disclosure pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Cannot control multiple disclosures at once',
    'Inconsistent accessible name computation',
    'Unintuitive role announcements',
    'Connected information is hard to find with AT',
  ]}
/>

Qwik UI includes a headless Accordion component that uses ARIA and JavaScript to enhance accessibility and usability for managing multiple sections smoothly.

> For more information on the inconsistencies of these native elements, see Scott O'Hara's [The details and summary elements, again](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html) article.

## Component State

### Initial value

To set a default or initial value on page load, use the `value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="initial" />

The `value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root>` was set to `item-2`, which is the value of the second item. As a result, the second item is selected by default.

### Reactive value

Pass reactive state by using the `bind:value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root /> `component.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

### Programmatic changes

You can also change the current expanded item values programmatically by updating the signal's value.

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

### Handling selection changes

Listen to when a new item is selected by passing a callback function to the `onChange$` prop.

<Showcase name="on-change" />

### Multiple items

To allow multiple items to be open at the same time, set the `multiple` prop to `true`.

<Showcase name="multiple" />

### Non-collapsible

To disable collapsible behavior, set the `collapsible` prop to `false`.

<Showcase name="collapsible" />

This will prevent the accordion from collapsing when the user clicks on the trigger.

### Disabled items

Items can be disabled by setting the `disabled` prop to true on the `<Accordion.Item />` component.

<Showcase name="disabled" />

> Disabled items are not selectable or focusable. They are also skipped when using the arrow keys to navigate through the items.

### Disabled Component

The component itself can also be disabled by setting the `disabled` prop to true on the `<Accordion.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="disabled-root" />

## Advanced

### Height Animation

To animate the Accordion content, the `--qwikui-collapsible-content-height` CSS variable in your keyframes.

<Showcase name="animation" />

> In the near future, you won't need JavaScript at all to animate the height of content! Here's the [CSS WG Proposal](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-values-5/calc-size-explainer.md) for more info.

<CodeSnippet name="animation.css" />

### Why does padding or border break the animation?

Padding or border applied to `Accordion.Content` breaks our keyframe animation above. This is because the content height has changed.

To fix this, add a child element to the content, and set the padding or border on that element.

```tsx
<Accordion.Content class="collapsible-animation collapsible-content">
  <p class="collapsible-content-outline">Content</p>
</Accordion.Content>
```

> Rather than dealing with this under the hood, we thought it'd be appropriate to keep style management as simple as possible. Let us know if you have a better solution!

### CSR

The Accordion automatically renders based on its environment. This means that it works for both server-side and client-side rendering.

<Showcase name="csr" />

### Dynamic

You have custom control over how to render items in the Accordion, allowing for dynamic rendering of items.

<Showcase name="dynamic" />

> This also updates the selected items, disabled items, and focus order automatically for you.

## Keyboard Interaction

<KeyboardInteractionTable
  keyDescriptors={[
    {
      keyTitle: 'Space',
      description: `Expands the content of the focused section.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Enter',
      description: `Expands the content of the focused section.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Tab',
      description: `Moves focus to the next element.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Shift + Tab',
      description: `Moves focus to the previous element.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'ArrowDown',
      description: `Moves focus to the next trigger.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'ArrowUp',
      description: `Moves focus to the previous trigger.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Home',
      description: `Moves focus to the first trigger.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'End',
      description: `Moves focus to the last trigger.`,
    },
