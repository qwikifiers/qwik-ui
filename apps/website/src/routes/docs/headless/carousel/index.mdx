### What's different to Swiper JS or Embla Carousel?

This component initially started as a wrapper around Swiper JS, but has since been rewritten natively in Qwik! It's a automatically optimized and a lightweight solution.

This component also intends to be more accessible with a powerful API.

### Why is there styles currently directly in headless?

The component itself does include headless logic, but also uses the flex layout algorithm, and is in sort of a "gray" zone betweeen styled / unstyled.

In the future, we would prefer a polished headless component (devoid of styles for most part).
