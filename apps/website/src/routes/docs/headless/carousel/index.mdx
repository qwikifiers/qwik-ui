## Why use the Qwik UI Carousel

### HTML until users care

The Carousel is a common widget in landing pages and SSR-rendered environments (even above the fold). Unlike many carousel libraries that rely on heavy JavaScript hydration, our implementation is designed to be:

- Environment agnostic (automatically SSR or CSR)
- HTML-first
- JavaScript-enhanced on interaction

The Carousel remains lightweight HTML until users interact with it through swiping, dragging, clicking, etc.

### Hardware acceleration

Initially, this component was built with normal scroll behavior (including CSS Scroll Snapping), but our testing found it to be janky on mobile the moment a custom animation was added.

> CSS Scroll snapping also currently does not support mouse drag.

The Qwik UI Carousel uses `CSS transforms` and `will-change` for smooth, hardware-accelerated animations, optimizing performance across devices, especially on mobile.

### Design Decisions

The Qwik UI Carousel is designed with the following intentions:

- Consistency with Qwik UI's API design for ease of use
- Modularity to support various use cases
- Extendable with custom components

## Alignment Options

### Start Alignment

The default alignment is `start`. Slides will snap to the left edge of the carousel.

<Showcase name="start" />

### Center Alignment

Set the `align` prop to `center` to align slides to the center of the carousel.

<Showcase name="center" />

### End Alignment

Set the `align` prop to `end` to align slides to the right edge of the carousel.

<Showcase name="end" />

## Component State

### Initial

To set an initial slide position, use the `startIndex` prop.

<Showcase name="initial" />

### Reactive

Reactively control the selected slide index by using the `bind:selectedIndex` prop.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

### Multiple Slides

Set the `slidesPerView` prop for multiple slides.

<Showcase name="multiple-slides" />

### Vertical

Qwik UI supports vertical carousels. Add the `orientation` prop with the value of `vertical` to the `<Carousel.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="vertical-direction" />

### Non-draggable

Opt-out of the draggable behavior by setting the `draggable` prop to `false`.

<Showcase name="non-draggable" />

### Different widths

By default, the slides will take up the full width of the carousel.

To change this, use the `flex-basis` CSS property on the `<Carousel.Slide />` component.

<Showcase name="different-widths" />

### Sensitivity

You can customize the sensitivity of the carousel dragging by passing an object with `mouse` and `touch` properties.

<Showcase name="sensitivity" />

The default values are `1.5` for `mouse` and `1.25` for `touch`.

> The example above uses `2.5` for `mouse` and `2.25` for `touch`.

### Move

You can customize the amount of slides to move when hitting the next or previous button by passing a number.

<Showcase name="move" />

The default value is `1`.

### No Scroll

Qwik UI supports carousels without a scroller, which can be useful for conditional slide carousels.

<Showcase name="without-scroller" />

Remove the `<Carousel.Scroller />` component to remove the scroller.

#### Example Conditional Animation

<Showcase name="conditional" />

```css
.carousel-conditional {
  position: relative;
  height: 200px;
}

.carousel-conditional .carousel-slide {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
  /* NOT display block */
  display: revert;
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
}

.carousel-conditional .carousel-slide[data-active] {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### CSR

Both SSR and CSR are supported. In this example, we conditionally render the carousel based on an interaction.

<Showcase name="csr" />

### Rewind

Rewind the carousel by setting the `rewind` prop to `true`.

<Showcase name="rewind" />

> When rewinding, navigation buttons are never disabled.

### Autoplay

To use autoplay, use the `bind:autoplay` prop.

<Showcase name="player" />

### Accessible name

By default, the carousel is automatically labeled with the `aria-label` attribute.

In the case that you want to add a custom accessible name, use the `<Carousel.Title />` component.

<Showcase name="title" />

To hide the title from screen readers, use the `<VisuallyHidden />` component.

> The title is automatically added to the carousel's `aria-labelledby` attribute.

#### What if I want to autoplay on initial render?

Use a visible task to change the signal passed to `bind:autoplay` to `true` when the component is visible.

```tsx
 {/* inside your component */}
  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    isAutoplaySig.value = true;
  })

  {/* the carousel */}
  <Carousel.Root bind:autoplay={isAutoplaySig}>
```

### Custom scroll animations

To create a custom animation, use a CSS transition on the scroller with the `transform` property.

<Showcase name="animate" />

```css
.carousel-animation {
  transition: 0.35s transform cubic-bezier(0.57, 0.16, 0.95, 0.67);
}
```

## Configurations

### Pagination

Use `<Carousel.Pagination />` and `<Carousel.Bullet />` components to add pagination.

<Showcase name="pagination" />

Inspired by [Adam Argyle's carousel examples](https://gui-challenges.web.app/carousel/dist/), the carousel component allows the pagination to be extendable, while intending to be intuitive.

> These are exposed to assistive technologies as tabs for screen readers.

### Stepper

The Carousel component also includes built-in accessibility support for steppers and setup wizards.

<Showcase name="stepper" />

Steps can be disabled and enabled based on the index of the current slide or any other piece of state.

> Steppers are seen by screen readers as a navigation area with series of steps that the user can navigate through.

#### No Scroll

Similar to Carousel's, steppers can be used without a scroller.

<Showcase name="stepper-no-scroll" />

#### Vertical

Vertical steppers can be created by changing the markup position of the stepper.

<Showcase name="vertical-stepper" />

#### Presentational

Create non-interactive steppers by setting the `as` prop to `div` or `span`. Use `Carousel.Next` and `Carousel.Previous` components for navigation instead.

<Showcase name="stepper-presentational" />

### Progress

You can also control the progress of the carousel by using the `bind:progress` prop.

<Showcase name="progress" />

In the above example, we also use the headless progress component to show the progress of the carousel.

### Initial Styles

> Styles are in an @layer for easy customization:

```css
@layer qwik-ui {
  [data-qui-carousel-viewport] {
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  [data-qui-carousel-scroller] {
    transform: var(--transform);
    will-change: transform;
    transition: 0.3s transform ease-out;

    display: flex;
    gap: var(--gap);
    flex-direction: var(--orientation);

    /* for initial slide position */
    scroll-snap-type: both mandatory;
    max-height: calc(var(--max-slide-height));
  }

  [data-qui-carousel-slide] {
    /* default, feel free to override */
    --total-gap-width: calc(var(--gap) * (var(--slides-per-view) - 1));
    --available-slide-width: calc(100% - var(--total-gap-width));
    --slide-width: calc(var(--available-slide-width) / var(--slides-per-view));

    flex-basis: var(--slide-width);
    flex-shrink: 0;
    position: relative;
  }

  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    [data-qui-carousel-player] {
      display: none;
    }
  }
}
```
