# Collapsible

## Why use a headless collapsible?

One of the most common questions: _"why not use the native `details` and `summary` HTML elements?"_.

As much as we love the native elements, they come with a couple of problems:

### Native element pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Inconsistent accessibility and browser support',
    'Inconsistent screen reader support',
    'Hierarchy and DOM structure restrictions',
    'Lack of full programmatic control',
  ]}
/>

> To read more about the reasons for implementing an ARIA disclosure widget, check out [Scott O'Hara's article](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html), as well as the [interactive elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#interactive-elements) section of the HTML spec.

## Component State

### Uncontrolled / Initial value

We can select an initial uncontrolled value by passing the `open` prop to the `<Collapsible.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="open" />

The above example expands the collapsible by default. Something to notice, is there isn't any layout shift when refreshing the page.

This is because the content is rendered on the server. Animations applied to `data-open` take effect after the initial render to prevent layout shift.

> Thanks to Qwik's JavaScript Streaming behavior, we can have open state components without even resuming them!

### Controlled / Reactive value

We can pass reactive state by using the bind:open prop to the `<Collapsible.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="bind-open" />

bind:open is a signal prop, and allows us to pass in our own signal to control the expanded state of the collapsible.

### Programmatic changes

Now that we have a controlled state, we can programmatically change the state of the collapsible by changing the value of the signal.

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

The example above toggles the expanded state of the collapsible by changing the value of the `isOpen` signal when the checkbox is clicked.

### Handling open / close

We may want to handle the open / close of the collapsible. For example, we may want execute some code when the collapsible is opened or closed.

<Showcase name="open-change" />

To do that, we can use the `onChange$` prop. A parameter is passed to the handler, which is a boolean indicating whether the collapsible is open or closed.

### Disabled collapsible

<Showcase name="disabled" />

The collapsible can be disabled by adding the `disabled` prop to the `<Collapsible.Root />` component.

## Animating the content

To animate the height of the content, we can use a keyframe animation on the height property.

<Showcase name="animation" />

### Height Animation

To animate the Accordion content, the `--qwikui-collapsible-content-height` CSS variable in your keyframes.

<Showcase name="animation" />

> In the near future, you won't need JavaScript at all to animate the height of content! Here's the [CSS WG Proposal](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-values-5/calc-size-explainer.md) for more info.

<CodeSnippet name="animation.css" />

### Why does padding or border break the animation?

Padding or border applied to `Collapsible.Content` breaks our keyframe animation above. This is because the content height has changed.

To fix this, add a child element to the content, and set the padding or border on that element.

```tsx
<Collapsible.Content class="collapsible-animation collapsible-content">
  <p class="collapsible-content-outline">Content</p>
</Collapsible.Content>
```

> Rather than dealing with this under the hood, we thought it'd be appropriate to keep style management as simple as possible. Let us know if you have a better solution!

## CSR

The collapsible can be rendered both server-side or client-side, same with the rest of the components.

<Showcase name="csr" />

The main difference, is there is no server to client handoff. This can be useful if you're navigating via SPA.

## Example CSS

<CodeSnippet name="collapsible.css" />

Every code example uses the following CSS:

## Keyboard Interaction

<KeyboardInteractionTable
  keyDescriptors={[
    {
      keyTitle: 'Space',
      description: `When focus is on the trigger, open or close the collapsible.`,
    },
    {
      keyTitle: 'Enter',
      description: `When focus is on the trigger open or close the collapsible.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## API

### Data Attributes

`Collapsible.Root`, `Collapsible.Trigger`, and `Collapsible.Content` all have the following data attributes that are used to track state:

<AnatomyTable
  firstColumnLabel="Attribute"
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'data-open',
      description: 'If the collapsible is open (Boolean).',
    },
    {
      name: 'data-closed',
      description: 'If the collapsible is closed (Boolean).',
    },
    {
      name: 'data-disabled',
      description: 'If the collapsible is disabled (Boolean).',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Collapsible.Root

<APITable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'open',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Uncontrolled initial expanded value.',
    },
    {
      name: 'bind:open',
      type: 'signal',
      description: 'Controlled expanded value, manages the collapsible content.',
      info: 'boolean',
    },
    {
      name: 'onOpenChange$',
      type: 'QRL',
      description: 'Function called when the collapsible opens or closes.',
      info: 'QRL<(open: boolean) => void>',
    },
    {
      name: 'disabled',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Disables the collapsible when true.',
    },
  ]}
/>
