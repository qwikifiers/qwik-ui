# Headless kit

Qwik UI is a tool to help you build better design systems. It includes components with **no default styles** and a [styled kit](../../styled/introduction/) with configurable presets. Both are fully customizable and accessible.

You are currently exploring the headless kit, which manages the essential structure, behavior, and state of advanced UI components. It also happens to be the world's fastest UI library, squeezing out every bit of performance. _(Like lemonade from lemons that had a run-in with a steamroller.)_ ðŸ¥¤

<Note status="warning">
  Qwik UI is currently in its **beta** phase. We appreciate your support and patience as
  we continue to add new features and make improvements. Expect some breaking changes
  until we reach version 1.0.
</Note>

## It's fast, like really fast

The claim of being the world's fastest UI library is genuine, not just marketing hype. In Qwik UI, every component starts as **lightweight HTML** and activates smaller pieces upon **user interaction**. Each event is handled independently, without affecting the entire component.

## Accessibility

Components in Qwik UI follow the [WAI-ARIA Design Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) when possible. The project manages ARIA attributes, focus management, and keyboard handling.

However, following these guidelines alone does not guarantee full accessibility. The headless kit tests with assistive technologies to ensure that people with disabilities can fully use your applications.

## Bring your own styles

Out of the box, components ship with zero or necessary behavioral styles, giving you complete control over your design. You can style them using any solution.

## Environment agnostic

Whether you're building a _SSG_ marketing page, _SSR_ e-commerce site, or _CSR_ dashboard, Qwik UI knows when each function should run on the server or the client for you.

## Developer experience

Our goal is to provide the **best developer experience**. Qwik UI offers fully-typed, discoverable, and composable components.
