            A web developer was hired by a company to create a website for their
            new product. He spent weeks designing and coding the website, making
            sure it was responsive, user-friendly, and SEO-optimized. He tested
            it on various browsers and devices, and fixed any bugs he found. He
            was proud of his work and confident that it would impress the
            client.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            He sent the website link to the client and waited for their
            feedback. A few hours later, he received an email from the client
            that read:
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            "Hi,
            <br />
            Thank you for your hard work on the website. It looks great, but we
            have one small issue. When we open the website on our computer, it
            says 'Hello World' in big letters on the screen. Is this some kind
            of joke? We don't understand what it means. Please remove it as soon
            as possible and replace it with something more appropriate.
            <br />
            Sincerely,
            <br />
            The Client"
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            The web developer was confused and shocked. He opened the website on
            his own computer and saw nothing wrong. He checked the code and
            found no trace of 'Hello World'. He tried different browsers and
            devices, but still couldn't reproduce the issue. He wondered if the
            client was playing a prank on him or if they had some kind of virus
            on their computer.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">He replied to the client:</p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            "Hi,
            <br />
            I'm glad you like the website, but I'm sorry to hear about the
            'Hello World' problem. I have checked the website on my end and I
            don't see anything like that. Can you please send me a screenshot of
            what you see? Also, can you tell me what browser and operating
            system you are using?
            <br />
            Thank you,
            <br />
            The Web Developer"
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            He waited for the client's response, hoping to solve the mystery. A
            few minutes later, he received another email from the client with an
            attachment. He opened it and saw a screenshot of the website with
            'Hello World' in big letters on the screen. He also noticed
            something else that made him facepalm.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8 leading-relaxed">
            The client was using Internet Explorer 6.
