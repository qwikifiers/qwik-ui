### Patch Changes

- ‚ú® changed to `kit-styled` (by [@shairez](https://github.com/shairez) in [#604](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/pull/604))

  Now the cli will only install `kit-styled` and generate the css variables according to which theme you choose.

- Updated dependencies [[`31dcec7`](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/commit/31dcec7ce266b3840f79a57ce303e1b71d6fab02)]:

### Patch Changes

- Removed the generated `nx.json` after `qwik-ui init` command. (by [@shairez](https://github.com/shairez) in [#598](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/pull/598))
  Apparently, only an empty `nx: {}` in the package.json is enough.
