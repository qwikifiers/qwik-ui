            Carl Joachim Andersen (29 April 1847 ‚Äì 7 May 1909) was a Danish
            flutist, conductor and composer born in Copenhagen, son of the
            flutist Christian Joachim Andersen. Both as a virtuoso and as
            composer of flute music, he is considered one of the best of his
            time. He was considered to be a tough leader and teacher and
            demanded as such a lot from his orchestras but through that style he
            reached a high level.
