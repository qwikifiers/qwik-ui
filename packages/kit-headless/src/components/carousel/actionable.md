# Accessibility Improvements for Carousel Component

## 1. Implement auto-rotation control

- Add a start/stop button for users to control auto-rotation [x]
- Pause rotation on hover, focus, or when reduced motion is preferred
- Disable auto-rotation completely as an option
- Ensure auto-rotation stops when keyboard focus enters the carousel
- Do not restart auto-rotation unless explicitly requested by the user

## 2. Ensure proper keyboard navigation

- Use arrow keys to move between tabs/slides [x]
- Implement Home and End keys to jump to first/last slide
- Manage focus with roving tabindex
- Ensure Tab and Shift+Tab move through interactive elements as specified by page tab sequence

## 3. Add appropriate ARIA attributes

- Use `aria-roledescription="carousel"` on the main container [x]
- Apply `role="region"` or `role="group"` to the carousel container based on page information architecture [x]
- Use `aria-roledescription="slide"` for slide containers in basic carousels [x]
- For tabbed carousels, use `role="tablist"` for the tab container and `role="tab"` and `role="tabpanel"` for individual slides [x]
- Implement `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` for accessible names on carousel container and slides [x]
- Add `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-label` on tabs in tabbed carousels

## 4. Implement live regions [x]

- Use `aria-live="polite"` when auto-rotation is off
- Set `aria-live="off"` when auto-rotation is on
- Optionally, set `aria-atomic="false"` on the element wrapping the set of slide elements

## 5. Ensure proper color contrast

- Maintain sufficient contrast for controls and text, especially when overlaying images
- Consider moving controls and captions outside the image area

## 6. Implement focus styling

- Highlight the entire tab list when a tab receives focus
- Ensure focus indicators are visible in high contrast mode
- Place the rotation control as the first element in the Tab sequence inside the carousel

## 7. Provide screen reader announcements

- Announce slide changes when auto-rotation is off
- Disable announcements when auto-rotation is on
- Ensure rotation control label changes to match the action it will perform (e.g., "Stop slide rotation" or "Start slide rotation")

## 8. Optimize for various devices and assistive technologies

- Ensure the carousel works well with mouse, keyboard, and touch inputs
- Test with different screen readers and browsers
- Implement controls as native button elements or use the button pattern
- For grouped carousels, use `aria-disabled="true"` on the picker button for the currently displayed slide

## 9. Implement different carousel styles

- Basic: Rotation, previous, and next slide controls
- Tabbed: Basic controls plus slide picker controls using the tabs pattern
- Grouped: Basic controls plus a group of slide picker controls using the button pattern

By implementing these items, you can create a more accessible and user-friendly carousel component that adheres to WAI-ARIA best practices and provides a consistent experience across different input methods and assistive technologies.
